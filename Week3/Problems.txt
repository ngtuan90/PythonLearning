1) Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Go to the editor
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

2)Write a Python program to get days between two dates. Go to the editor 
Sample Dates : 2000,2,28, 2001,2,28
Expected Output : 366 days, 0:00:00

3)1Write a Python program for binary search. Go to the editor
Binary Search : In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomies divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.
Test Data :
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 6) -> False
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 5) -> True

4)Write a Python program to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. Go to the editor
Test Data : 
(power(3,4) -> 81 

5)Write a Python program to generate all sublists of a list
