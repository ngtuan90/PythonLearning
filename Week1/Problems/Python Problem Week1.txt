Problem 1:
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game

Remember the rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

Problem 2:
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.

Problem 3:
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right

Problem 4:
Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:
  My name is Michele
Then I would see the string:
  Michele is name My
shown back to me.

Problem 5:
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
Extra:
Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
